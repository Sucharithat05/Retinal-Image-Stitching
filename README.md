# Retinal-Image-Stitching
Used the FIRE Dataset available in kaggle and did the project in Googl Colab where we used Traditional stitching methods like SIFT/SURF for stitching the retinal and normal images.
Did the project in Kaggle also using the same dataset where we used Deep Learing Methods such as CNN in that we've used HCNN for training the model for stitching multiple overlapping pairs of retinal images.
Finally, we compared both the models and came to conclusion that HCNN is producing better results and seamless stitching results than Traditional methods.
